# Bully-Ribs

Here you can find all the files for the Bully-Ribs project.

What could be improved:

- In KiCad I used the nice!nano controller, but I actually built it with a ProMicro RP2040, so the pin labels on the silkscreen are not correct :)))))))

- The PCB doesnâ€™t have a reset button, but luckily the ProMicro RP2040 does.

- The case has the USB cutout a bit too high, so I just trimmed some plastic.
